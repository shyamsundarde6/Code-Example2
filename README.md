 String is a sequence of characters. In Java, objects of String are immutable which means they are constant and cannot be changed once created.


Using user-defined function : Define a function to compare values with following conditions :
1.if (string1 > string2) it returns a positive value.
2.if both the strings are equal lexicographically
  i.e.(string1 == string2) it returns 0.
3.if (string1 < string2) it returns a negative value.
The value is calculated as (int)str1.charAt(i) â€“ (int)str2.charAt(i)
